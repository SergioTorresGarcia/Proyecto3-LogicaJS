- ##### Project explanation: üí¨

The idea is to find the best way to combine halves with different prices, paying for the most expensive of each group of 3.
We look for a function that takes 3 arguments (a, b, c) that are the number of empanadas (the 3 original types - chicken, meat & veggies)
General premises:
    - 3x1 offer (pay the highest price)
    - Total number of empanadas is less than 40
    - Total number of empanadas is multiple of 3
    - There are 3 types of empanadas
    - You can join 2 different halves in one empanada (paying the average price)

After writing the proper code, the exercise would be done after all tests are passed üëå

MY SOLUTION of this exercise is simple:
 - 3 if statements take care of the possible errors:
    - total order is not multiple of 3
    - total order is more than 40
    - one or more of the ammounts (a, b, c) is less than 0.
- Given the previous conditions, I find the arithmetic mean of total order.
    - I would add all order ammounts (a, b and c) as "total price"
    - And divide it by 3
    - This would result in a decimal number, that I would round up using "Math.ceil()"

After a first try I checked the expected results of tests were whole numbers, so I used Math.floor.
Then changed it to Math.ceil as I realised they were rounded up.
Last I took care of Errors using "throw Error".
For this I did 3 separate "ifs" with different error messages but it could be done altoghether as a general "throw Error"
